# Advertisement Click Prediction using Logistic Regression  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset includes features such as **age, estimated salary, daily internet usage**, and **clicked on ad** as the target variable.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used **Seaborn & Matplotlib** to visualize distributions, correlations, and trends.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, standardized numerical features, and performed feature engineering.  
- **Model Implementation**: Built a **Logistic Regression model** using **Scikit-learn**, optimized with **Hyperparameter tuning**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC Curve** for model assessment.  
- **Model Interpretation**: Visualized decision boundaries and analyzed feature importance.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- **Rows**: 1,000+  
- **Columns**: Age, Estimated Salary, Daily Internet Usage, Clicked on Ad, etc.  
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (Clicked on Ad: Yes/No).  

## âš¡ Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation)
